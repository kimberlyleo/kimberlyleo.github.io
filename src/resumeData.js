It was the best job I ever had (really) because it consistently challenged me and allowed me to learn new techologies and languages. It made me very excited to continue my journey as a Software Engineer/Code Wizard. I am excited grow my skills and build great things that bring people joy. I am currently studying (Python, UX, & Agile) and enjoying building a mobile app with Swift; next up: Android/Kotlin and Machine Learning.",
